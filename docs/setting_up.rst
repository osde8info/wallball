Setting Up
==========

Before we start programming, we need to make sure everything's in place for us to write
our code and run it.

Create a working directory
--------------------------

* Run a terminal prompt

* If there isn't one, create a directory called `work-in-progress`

* Inside that directory, create a directory called `wallball`

* Type: `which pgzrun`

Create an empty file
--------------------

* Start IDLE3

* Dismiss the Interpreter window

* File > Save As > ~/work-in-progress/wallball/wallball.py
