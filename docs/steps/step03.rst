Step 4: Add bricks for the ball to knock out
============================================

In this step we're going to put a row of "bricks" along the top of the
game screen, each one a different colour. When the ball hits a brick,
the brick disappears. When all the bricks have been knocked out, the
player has won.

Step 4a: Put one brick on the screen
------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s3a.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the colour of the brick
* Make the brick appear at the right of the screen

Step 4b: Put eight bricks across the screen
-------------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s3b.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the number of bricks
* Change how high each brick is
* Add or remove some colours
* Make each brick a randomly-chosen colour

Step 4c: Have the ball knock out bricks until none is left
----------------------------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s3c.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Have the ball change colour according to which brick it's knocked out
