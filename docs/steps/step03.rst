Step 3: Add bricks for the ball to knock out
============================================

In this step we're going to put a row of "bricks" along the top of the
game screen, each one a different colour. When the ball hits a brick,
the brick disappears. When all the bricks have been knocked out, the
player has won.

Step 3a: Put one brick on the screen
------------------------------------

The Code

    :linenos:

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the colour of the brick
* Make the brick appear at the right of the screen

Step 3b: Put eight bricks across the screen
-------------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

..  literaldiff:: code/s3b.py
    :diff: code/s3a.py
    :linenos:

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the number of bricks
* Change how high each brick is
* Add or remove some colours
* Make each brick a randomly-chosen colour

Step 3c: Have the ball knock out bricks until none is left
----------------------------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

..  literaldiff:: code/s3c.py
    :diff: code/s3b.py
    :linenos:
