Step 3: Make the player's bat deflect the ball
==============================================

In this step we're going to put an oblong "bat" along the bottom of the
screen. It will move left and right when the player moves the mouse.
When the ball hits the bat it will bounce off it.

Finally, now that we have a bat in place, the player will die if the ball
reaches the bottom edge of the screen.
