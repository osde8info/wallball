Change it all around
====================

Now your game is working. It's time to play around with it to see how to make
it more interesting, or more challenging, or just more quirky. Here are some ideas,
but you should really think up your own: it's your game; make it different from
everyone else's.

Have several layers of bricks
-----------------------------

The game only has one wall of bricks at the moment. Try adding some more walls.

:ref:`Look here <several-layers-of-bricks>` for a possible approach

Give each side wall a bat
-------------------------

This is easy to do and makes the game quite a bit more tricky. The idea is to make
it so the ball doesn't bounce off the side walls: you have to deflect it with a bat.
So you need a vertical bat on each side wall which is also controlled by the mouse.

:ref:`Look here <two-bats-along-the-side>` for a possible approach

Have more than one ball
-----------------------

You could have two balls, perhaps one running faster, the other slower. Or one bigger,
one smaller. These both have to be deflected in the usual way. Perhaps one ball can
only knock out certain bricks.

:ref:`Look here <more-than-one-ball>` for a possible approach

Have two bats along the bottom
------------------------------

Even if just one player you could have two bats, one which only moves when the
left mouse button is pressed, the other when the right button is pressed.

:ref:`Look here <two-bats-along-the-bottom>` for a possible approach

Have different kinds of bricks
------------------------------

You could give the bricks different properties: one might only be knocked out
after three hits. Perhaps one hit weakens it and it changes to a weaker 2-hit
brick.

:ref:`Look here <different-bricks>` for a possible approach

Switch around the direction of play
-----------------------------------

Have the wall of bricks along the left edge of the screen and the bat along
the right. Or a wall in the middle of the screen with bats along each edge.

Make the ball move differently
------------------------------

You could have the ball curve rather than use straight lines. Or it could change
its velocity or direction according to which brick it hits. It could move in
a sine wave or a parabola.
