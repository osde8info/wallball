Step 2: Bounce a ball around the screen
=======================================

In this step we're going to put a square "ball" on the screen and
then to make it move, bouncing off each of the walls when it hits them.

* Have the ball appear somewhere different every time

* Change the angle at which the ball moves

Step 2c: Make the ball bounce off the walls
