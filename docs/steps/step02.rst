Step 2: Make the ball bounce off the bat
========================================

In this step we're going to put an oblong "bat" along the bottom of the
screen. It will move left and right when the player moves the mouse.
When the ball hits the bat it will bounce off it.

Finally, now that we have a bat in place, the player will die if the ball
reaches the bottom edge of the screen.

Step 2a: Put a bat on the screen
--------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s2a.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the colour of the bat
* Change the size of the bat
* Change where the bat starts

Step 2b: Control the bat with the mouse
---------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s2b.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make the bat move left & right according to the up and down movement of the mouse
* Make the bat move up and down as well as left and right
* Make the bat move only when one of the buttons is pressed

Step 2c: Make the ball bounce off the bat
-----------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s2c.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make the ball go backwards when it hits the bat
* Make the ball go randomly faster or slower when it hits the bat

Step 2d: The player dies if the ball hits the bottom of the screen
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Code
~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: code/s2d.py

Change it around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make the ball change colour several times to show you've died
