Stage II: Introduce status and screens
--------------------------------------

Up to now, your game starts when you run the program, and then runs,
and then stops when the bricks are all knocked out or the ball drops
off the screen.

In this stage, you'll add a sense of context (called "state" by programmers)
to the game: a running score and a welcome screen.
