Stage II: Introduce status and screens
--------------------------------------

..  warning::
    From this point, we'll assume that you're rather more familiar with
    writing code in Python than we you started this workshop. So we won't
    limit ourselves so much to baby steps. We will continue to highlight
    what's happening in each step. But there'll be more changes more quickly.

Up to now, your game starts when you run the program, and then runs,
and then stops when the bricks are all knocked out or the ball drops
off the screen.

In this stage, you'll add a sense of context (called "state" by programmers)
to the game: a running score and a welcome screen.
