We're going to build a simple computer game which I've called "Wall Ball".
The code is broken out into simple steps, each of which adds something
to the program until the entire game is possible. At each step you can
change things around and when the game is complete you can make other
changes to make the game harder or more interesting.

The aim *isn't* for you to end up with a computer game! If that's all you
want, you can go home and find a thousand games better than this one. The
aim is for you to make a simple game which you can then make your own. No-one
else's game will have the particular ideas which yours has. Make it yours.
