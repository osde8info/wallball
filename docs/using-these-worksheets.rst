Using these worksheets
======================

Before we start coding: how to use these worksheets.

* The code is presented for you to type in, one step at a time.

* Every step builds on the previous one and results in a visible
  change to the game. The new parts of the code are shown in yellow.
  
* Code which you should remove is shown in yellow with a ##DELETE flag.
  
* Each step has suggestions for changing things around. You should definitely
  try at least one of these: the idea is for you to understand the code enough
  to be able to play around with it. Make it yours.
  
* If line numbers are shown next to the code you *should not* type them in.

* You *don't have* to type the comments (the lines which begin with a #).
  But they can help you later when you want to understand the code or make changes.

* You can, of course, copy and paste the code from the worksheet into your program. 
  But I suggest you don't. The very act of typing code in helps you to understand 
  it (and doesn't do your typing skills any harm!).
