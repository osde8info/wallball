Using these worksheets
======================

One last thing before we start coding: how to use these worksheets.

* The code is presented for you to type in, one step at a time.

* Every step builds on the previous one and results in a visible
  change to the game. The new parts of the code are shown in yellow.
  
* Occasionally, to produce a result, a step will do something
  simple which then will then be replaced by something more sophisticated
  in a later step. Parts which have now been removed are shown in yellow 
  with a ##DELETE flag.
  
* Each step has suggestions for changing things around. You should definitely
  try at least one of these: the idea is for you to understand the code enough
  to be able to play around with it. Make it yours.
  
* If line numbers are shown next to the code you *should not* type them in.

* You *don't have* to type the comments (the lines which begin with a #).
  They're there to help you understand the code. If you're a decent typist,
  it's a good idea to put them in; they'll help you later when you want to
  make changes. If you're a slow typist, you can leave them out: the computer
  ignores them when it runs your program.

* You can, of course, copy and paste the code from the worksheet into your program. 
  But I suggest you don't. The very act of typing code in helps you to understand 
  it (and doesn't do your typing skills any harm!).
